# Delegates

## Book: Interactive C#

### Func Delegates

* There are many forms of the Func delegate. They can take 0 to 16 input parameters but always have one return type.
  
### Action Delegates

* Action delegates can take 1 to 16 input parameters but do not have a return type.

### Predicate Delegates

* Predicate delegates are used to evaluate something. For example, a method defines some criteria and we need to check whether an object can meet the criteria.
